Wordle-in-Python
I followed the following youtube tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyWeex-S6d0&t=2s by Pixegami. The main reason I wanted to do this project was working on committing and pushing code on Atom ide. I want to implement alphabet feature of the wordle to this repo in the futute.
